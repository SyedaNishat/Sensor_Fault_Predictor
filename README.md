# Sensor Fault Detection and Prediction Dashboard

A **Streamlit-based interactive dashboard** to detect, classify, visualize, and export sensor faults using real-time data analysis, fault severity classification, and database integration.

---

## Project Overview

This dashboard allows users to:

* Upload sensor CSV files
* Preprocess and reshape data for analysis
* Detect and classify sensor faults
* Visualize sensor trends and fault patterns
* Understand fault severity breakdown
* Store and retrieve data in a SQLite database
* Export filtered, processed data

##  Features

ðŸ‘‰ File upload with validation
ðŸ‘‰ Preprocessing (wide-to-long format)
ðŸ‘‰ Fault classification (`Very Low`, `Low`, `Normal`, `High`, `Very High`)
ðŸ‘‰ Severity tagging (`None`, `Warning`, `Critical`)
ðŸ‘‰ Date range filtering (default: last 7 days)
ðŸ‘‰ Sensor-wise fault summary
ðŸ‘‰ Line plots for sensor readings
ðŸ‘‰ Bar charts for fault distribution
ðŸ‘‰ SQLite database integration
ðŸ‘‰ Filtered CSV export
ðŸ‘‰ Clean, recruiter-friendly UI

##  Sample Output

| Component    | Example                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
|  Fault Type | `Very Low`, `Normal`, `Very High` |
|  Severity   | `Critical`, `None`, `Warning`     |
|  Line Plot | Sensor readings over time         |
|  Bar Chart | Fault counts per sensor           |

##  How It Works

1. **Upload a CSV** with sensor readings (`Timestamp`, `Sensor_1`, `Sensor_2`, ...).
2. **Preprocessing** transforms it to long format and parses timestamps.
3. **Fault Classification** is applied using defined thresholds.
4. **Data Filtering** by date range enables focused analysis.
5. **Visualization** using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
6. **SQLite Integration** saves processed data.
7. **Export** the filtered result to a new CSV.

## Example Input Format

```csv
Timestamp,Sensor_1,Sensor_2,Sensor_3
2025-01-01 00:00,50.0,30.0,90.0
2025-01-01 00:01,55.0,35.0,100.0
```
